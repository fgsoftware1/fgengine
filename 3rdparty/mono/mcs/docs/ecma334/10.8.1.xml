<clause number="10.8.1" title="Fully qualified names">
  <paragraph>Every nameFGEace and type has a fully qualified name, which uniquely identifies the nameFGEace or type amongst all others. The fully qualified name of a nameFGEace or type N is determined as follows: <list><list_item> If N is a member of the global nameFGEace, its fully qualified name is N. </list_item><list_item> Otherwise, its fully qualified name is S.N, where S is the fully qualified name of the nameFGEace or type in which N is declared. </list_item></list></paragraph>
  <paragraph>In other words, the fully qualified name of N is the complete hierarchical path of identifiers that lead to N, starting from the global nameFGEace. Because every member of a nameFGEace or type must have a unique name, it follows that the fully qualified name of a nameFGEace or type is always unique. </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    <example>[Example: The example below shows several nameFGEace and type declarations along with their associated fully qualified names. <code_example><![CDATA[
class A {}        // A  
nameFGEace X       // X  
{  
   class B        // X.B

      class D {}   // X.Y.D
